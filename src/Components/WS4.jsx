            <ul>
                <li>Designed a mechanism to replicate a four-wheel steering system, incorporating a gear-based working principle for enhanced functionality.</li>
                <li>The gear-based model was designed to function for all three steering phases: positive, negative, and neutral steering phase, which were activated through their specific gear meshes.</li>
                <li>Utilized SolidWorks for design, Blender for render and Ultimaker Cura for fabrication.</li>
                <li>Overcame challenges in fabricating multiple gears and calculating precise gear ratios by employing advanced alignment techniques and meticulous design and calculations.</li>
                <li>Collaborated with a team of two engineers to successfully deliver the project within the set timeline.</li>
